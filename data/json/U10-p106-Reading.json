      "text": "<h4>A match made in heaven</h4> <p>Is there anything wrong with wanting to find a ‘soulmate’ - that one special person who will make the perfect partner? Many of us believe that this is the only kind of true love there is because we’ve been brought up on a diet of romantic pop songs and films that idealise love. We cling to the idea, even though we suspect it’s doomed to failure. After all, around 50 percent of marriages end in divorce in many western countries. So why is the soulmate myth so powerful? Maybe it’s because we don’t like thinking that life is messily random. Or we need a romantic way of describing intense physical attraction. Or maybe it’s just shorthand for the kind of overwhelming emotion we don’t quite understand.</p> <p>Throughout history, many great works of literature such as Shakespeare’s <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> have been based on the idea of romantic love, as have popular works of contemporary fiction such as <i>One Day</i> and <i>Twilight</i>. This isn’t a preoccupation found only in Western cultures either. A Chinese story about lovers destined to be together, regardless of social class, background or geography, dates back to the ninth century. Many of these stories have tragic endings; <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> being a famous example.</p> <p>The founding father of romance is often thought to be the ancient Greek philosopher, Plato. But it was actually the Romantic poet, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who came up with the term ‘soulmate’, as we understand it today. ‘To be happy in married life ... you must have a soulmate,’ he said in a letter in 1822. This was an unconventional opinion, which probably seemed revolutionary at the time, but these days, searching for spiritual completion is the norm.</p> <p>Not everyone subscribes to this view, however. A recent study on attitudes to long-term relationships found that couples who have been together a long time are more likely to refer to each other as ‘best friends’ rather than ‘soulmates’, and are unconvinced by the representation of romance in popular culture. They know these over-idealised romances don’t bear any relation to reality - so they don’t take them seriously.</p> <p>A pragmatic approach to love would seem to give relationships a better chance of survival. Research carried out by a professor of social psychology at the University of Houston showed that people believing in romantic destiny tend to have relationships that are passionate but short-lived. Only perfection will do - if things go wrong, this can’t be ‘The One’. Research published by Prof. Spike Lee, of Toronto University, and Prof. Norbert Schwarz, of the University of Southern California, confirms these findings. ‘People who implicitly think of relationships as perfect unity between soulmates have worse relationships than people who implicitly think of relationships as a journey of growing and working things out.’</p> <p>Finding a partner can seem overwhelming if you’re convinced you’ve got to search the entire world for just one person, so these days many of us have come round to the idea that fate may need a helping hand. This is why one in five UK relationships starts online. As Lori Laius, of Telegraph Dating, says, ‘You’re using today’s technology to help you find someone special.’ This suits men in particular, who typically have always been more hard-headed about the possibility of finding a match made in heaven. And although meeting online doesn’t quite live up to the romantic ideal, it’s now just as normal as meeting someone at a party or at work.</p>"
